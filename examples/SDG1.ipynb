        "Synthetic data generation using large language models (LLMs) offers a powerful solution to a commonly faced problem: the availability of high-quality, diverse, and privacy-compliant data. This could be used in a number of scenarios such as training a data science  machine learning model (SVMs, decision trees, KNN's), finetuning a different GPT model on the data, as a solution to the coldstart problem, helping build compelling demos/apps with realistic data, scenario testing etc.\n",

        "2. Synthetic data can be much more structured and therefore easier to manipulate than real data. \n",
        "3. In domains where data is sparse or data of certain categories is sparse we may want to augment the data. \n",
